# OmniCritic

OmniCritic is a template for a **critic-aggregator-aggregator webapp**. 

Have you ever said *"I wish I could get a easy-to-browse list of *everything* [media vendor] streams, from best- to worst-ratings averaged across rating aggregators?"* No? Well you are a patient person. At any rate, that's what this does.

## IMPORTANT Disclaimer
This is for personal use and, if you build a ratings database, it should probably **not** be shared publicly! Media aggregator websites have EULAs â€” some of them prohibit scraping and republishing their content. **It is your responsibility** to consider whether information you gather is suitable for storage or publication.

[Live demo](https://jddh.dev/omnicritic) with fake data based on public-domain books

## Moving Parts
1. Node-based CLI for pulling media information from RapidAPI endpoints (such as UNOGS) and cross-referencing media titles with rating aggregations (such as IMDB, Metacritic and Rottentomatoes)
2. Node/MongoDB storage schema for all of the above
3. Simple Express API for serving the data
4. Bespoke, low-dependancy React frontend with routes, auth/watchlists and lots of switches and knobs to browse the data 

## Installation
1. `node install` dependencies
2. Copy ./.env-example to ./.env; Subscribe to UNOGS and put your API credentials in 
3. `docker compose up -d` 
4. Install the database schema and index: `node colonel action=install`
5. Run your first title fetch loop with with `node colonel action=gettitles` (you may want to make a cron job out of this action)
6. Search for rating scores for the titles you've gathered with `node colonel action=ratings` (ditto)
7. Alternatively to scraping, you can import sample data:
   
       curl -s https://jddh.dev/omnicritic/omnicritic-titles.csv | docker exec -i colonel-mongo-1 sh -c 'exec mongoimport --authenticationDatabase=admin  --username=admin --password=password  --db=omnicritic --collection=titles --type=csv --headerline --file='
8. To spin up the frontend run the profile with `docker compose --profile site up -d`
9.  Visit the frontend at `http://localhost:6361` and let your fingers do the walking

## Troubleshooting
- Not getting hits for rating scores? This scraper uses title and year of release to find a valid match. Contrary to how rating aggregators position themselves, they don't carry metadata for evrything. 
- Looking for user creation on the frontend? Auth is stubbed in to facilitate watchlisting, but account creation and management is on you. You can create a new user on the backend with `node newuser user=[user] password=[password]`
